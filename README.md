# COLLISION LAYERS REFERENCE (ADJUST TO FIT, DO NOT CHANGE THIS)
### This is the layer that these entities should live on. The mask layer is what a given entity can see, so adjust accordingly
- Walls = 1
- Pack of Rats = 2
- Rats = 3
- Food = 4
- Enemies = 5

## Basics:
1. Clone this repo into '.../Godot/Projects' directory
2. In the godot project menu use the "Import" button at the top left and navigate to the project.godot file
3. Edit the project and try running it with the play button at the top right
4. When you want to start editing/messing around **make your own directory for all of your scenes and resources**
	- *Make your own branch too if you know what you're doing*


# Biggest Pain:
Godot's project settings are stored within the project.godot file, so if you make changes to the project settings, then it's global. To combat this, we can work in our branches and just deal with it when the time comes to merge.
